## Stopwatch Implementation Using Multisim

This project demonstrates the implementation of a stopwatch that counts up to one minute using Multisim software. The circuit design includes a decoder, counter, and 7-segment display to visualize the elapsed time.

### Components Used:
- **Decoder**: Decodes the binary output from the counter to drive the 7-segment display.
- **Counter**: Keeps track of the elapsed time in seconds.
- **7-Segment Display**: Displays the current count in a readable format.

### Features:
- Counts up to 60 seconds (1 minute).
- Real-time visualization of the countdown on a 7-segment display.
- Accurate time-keeping using Multisim's simulation capabilities.

### How to Use:
1. Open the provided Multisim file in your Multisim software.
2. Run the simulation to start the stopwatch.
3. Observe the count on the 7-segment display.
